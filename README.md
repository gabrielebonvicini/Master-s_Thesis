# Thesis-code

The R file is the code utilized to write my Master's Thesis titled "Should investors care about disagreement in ESG ratings? 
An analysis of the impact on selected financial metrics."

Please note that the code cannot be executed without the Excel files containing the datasets. As I am unable to share the data, the code should be intended as an example of the methodology implemented in the analysis of the disagreement, potentially aiding further research in the field.

In addition, the shiny application built to assess the impact of the disagreement on transaction costs and returns, and presented in Chapter 9: Portfolio Construction, is available at the following link: [https://gabrielebonvicini.shinyapps.io/trade_cost_analysis/](https://gabrielebonvicini.shinyapps.io/trade_cost_analysis/ "SHINY APP").

The code used to built the shiny app is deployed in app.R and help.R files.
